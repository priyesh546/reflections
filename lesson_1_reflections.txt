How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Bug was found easily and hence could be eliminated easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having the entire log of the changes made throughout the history allows to return to any point in time and thus giving more flexibility to code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    A commit should be made each time a logical change occurs , be it the a bug correction or any other type of logical change.
    One commit per logical change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is practically more useful.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using commits and checkouts we can go to any version of the file and use it.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can alaways go to the previous version of the code hence making changes is very easy.
